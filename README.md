# Bike-Store-Sales-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation using MS Excel)

## Project Objective
To draw valuable insights from the Sales Data using the dataset from a bike store.

## Dataset used
-	<a href = https://github.com/abishtuladhar1/Bike-Sales-Excel-Project-/blob/main/BikeSales%20Dataset.xlsx > Bike Store Sales Data </a>

## Questions (KPIs)
-	What is the average income of the people who come to the store? What are their age group and genders?
-	What age group is more likely to purchase the bike?
-	What gender group is more likely to purchase the bike?
-	What is the commute distance for customers who buy and donâ€™t buy the bike?
-	Which region do these customers reside and what are their behaviors toward buying a bike?

## Process
- Removed Duplicates from the data and perform other data cleaning and transformations
- Used the "Find and Replace" Function to make structured consistent data
- Used Nested IF function for conditional formatting
- Categorized and structured the data
- Added Pivot tables, specified values, and added Pivot Charts
- Performed Pivot Chart Analysis, and added slicers and reported slicer connection to all the Analysis charts.

## Project Insights
- Middle-aged customers were more likely to buy a bike than adolescent customers.
- Middle-aged buyers were more common than adolescent buyers.
- Male customers are equally likely to purchase than female customers.
- Customers having shorter commute distance to work, were more likely to purchase a bike.
- Majority of Customers were from the middle age bracket (31-64) years.

## Conclusion
To improve the sales of the bike store, as shown in the example given above, the store manager should focus on middle-aged customers (ranging from 31 to 64 years old), who are more likely to purchase a bike. A strategic marketing plan focused on these age group men and women should be implemented. Discount programs to knock some value off of bike MSRP for middle age students and workers might encourage more customers from that age range to buy a bike from the store.  This demographic represents a key consumer segment, as they often make significant lifestyle purchases.
